            I'm a passionate and motivated web developer, currently pursuing my
            education in Computer Science. I love crafting modern, responsive
            web applications that blend performance with great UI/UX.
          </p>
          <p>
            My core stack includes React, Node.js, MongoDB, and PHP, but Iâ€™m
            always excited to explore and learn new technologies. I've built
            scalable systems and collaborated in agile teams to bring ideas to
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of code, I enjoy using Canva, exploring new tools, and
            working with data science tools like Jupyter and Scilab.
